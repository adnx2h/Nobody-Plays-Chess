# Nobody-plays-Chess
What to do when you like to play chess in a real board but nobody around you plays chess?

How about use the C++ power to create a chess board and a camera to track the moves and sending them to chess.com, lichess.com 
to play in a real board with real people.

Yes i will move clear and dark pieces but in the long run a robotic arm will move one side.
